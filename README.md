# Hi, I'm Mmedara!
I am your guardian. <br>
I protect you and your organisation from cybercriminals by detecting attacks before they happen to save you the cost of implementing an incident response plan <i>and</i> tracking attackers if they breach to make sure they don't get away with sensitive data.
